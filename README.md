## Photo-Upload-FrontEnd

A React-Boilerplate for the Technopathic Full-Stack Web Development series was used in the creation of this site.

This Photo-Upload-FrontEnd includes features such as CSS-loading and Styled-Components. React-Icons, React-Responsive, and Material-UI are also included by default for UI/UX design.

## Getting Started
To reuse this code as a framework, fork this repo and clone it onto your local computer. Then run `npm install` to install all of the necessary libraries.
```
git clone https://github.com/CJacobson1986/Photo-Upload-FrontEnd.git
cd ToDo-List
npm install
```

From there you should go ahead and generate a new Container for Home `npm run generate container`. Next, you should uncomment the Home route in the routes.js file.

To run the server, simply do `npm run start` and your development website will be on http://localhost:3000.


## Commands
To generate Containers:
`npm run generate container`

To generate Components:
`npm run generate component`
